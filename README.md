# Windows velocity feature lists
Continuing past efforts at providing dumps of velocity features for Windows (mostly Insider) builds, previously done by [mach2 creator Rafael Rivera](https://github.com/riverar/mach2). I scan the following builds consistently:
- Windows Insider Canary Channel builds
- Windows Insider Server (`ge_prereleaseserver` branch) builds
- Windows Insider Dev Channel builds
- Windows Insider Beta Channel builds

as of January 2026.
Other builds/CUs may get feature lists but there is no promise of consistent uploads for builds that aren't listed above.

A similar folder structure and file names to those seen in the original Mach2 repo, and the `diff` tool from UnxUtils to create the diff files, are used for familiarity.
